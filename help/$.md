# `$`

Same as `exec` command from `shelljs` package, but instead returns just the command output.

    /**
     * @param cmd {string}
     * @param opts
     * @param cb
     * @returns {string}
     */
     
The `$` symbol resembles a terminal prompt, thus this symbol was chosen as a function for executing shell commands.
An example in *CoffeeScript*:

```coffeescript
$ 'ifconfig'
```
